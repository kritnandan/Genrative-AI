**Project Overview**
In this project, I delved into the realm of Generative AI, successfully implementing a Large Language Model (LLM) and Transformer. The project involved encoding and decoding mechanisms, along with the incorporation of a softmax function. Through this endeavor, we effectively extracted answers to questions posed within the dataset.

Moreover, the model demonstrated its versatility by facilitating language translation, seamlessly converting text from one language to another. This project not only honed my understanding of Generative AI but also showcased the practical application of LLM, transformer architecture, and associated functions in solving real-world problems.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of:

Patient's current weight
Weight loss
Alcohol assumptions
Smoking status
Medication
The model uses the encoder and decoder mechanisms to answer questions related to the dataset.
