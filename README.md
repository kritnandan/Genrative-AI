In this project, I delved into the realm of Generative AI, where I successfully implemented the Language Model (LLM) and Transformer. The project involved encoding and decoding mechanisms, along with the incorporation of a softmax function. Through this endeavor, we were able to effectively extract answers to questions posed within the dataset.
Moreover, the model demonstrated its versatility by facilitating language translation, seamlessly converting text from one language to another. This project not only honed my understanding of Generative AI but also showcased the practical application of LLM, transformer architecture, and associated functions in solving real-world problems.
